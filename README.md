The smart IoT home has always been one of the most advanced and popular concepts of the new age and is sought after by
countless people. To date, there are several smart device companies on the market offering their full range of smart IoT
home product solutions, providing a new way of living in the home for people around the world who love technology and
IoT convenience.

Based on the concept of providing a simple, convenient and user-friendly smart home, BUPT Home has combined the best of
what is already available in the market and introduced a new smart home product platform solution for users. It is a
comprehensive solution consisting of a user side, a management side and hardware facilities.

In our smart homes, the comfort of the user is always at the forefront of the experience. Therefore, our Smart Home
Management System has a user-friendly login and management interface. It also has simple, accurate and easy-to-use
electronic hardware. We currently offer our customers a smart home with four devices: doors, lights, fans and sensors.
Each device is connected to the Internet, allowing users to view and control their smart devices from a remote location.
This is a great example of how intelligent the Smart House is. Of course, as the device manufacturers update the
platform, more devices will be added to the platform to create more possibilities for the users' smart life.

We sincerely hope that our Smart House will bring convenience and safety to everyone who uses it, and that everyone will
feel the charm of a modern Smart House.

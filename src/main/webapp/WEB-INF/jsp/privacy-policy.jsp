                    <br><h4>II. How we use cookies and similar technologies</h4></br>
                           <br>When you use our website, we may collect tracking information, such as your browser type, operating system type, Internet service provider name, and the pages you visit on our website, etc. BUPT Smart Home uses a variety of technologies to obtain this information, including digital stubs (cookies) and web beacons (web beacons), to enhance the functionality of our BUPT Smart Home uses a variety of technologies to obtain this information, including cookies and web beacons, to enhance the functionality of our website and its ease of use and to make our website, products and services more responsive to your needs. In addition, we use this information to confirm the eligibility of visitors to request services and to aggregate site activity data.</br>
                    <br><h4>(i) Cookies</h4></br>
                           <br>A cookie is a string of information in text format that is transferred from a website to a digital stub folder on your computer's hard drive so that the website remembers your identity. Typically, a digital stub file contains the name of the domain in which it resides, the "lifetime" of the digital stub, and a randomly generated unique value. This site uses two types of digital stubs, temporary digital stubs, which remain in your browser's digital stub folder for as long as you browse the site, and persistent digital stubs, which remain in your browser for a longer period of time (depending on the lifetime of the digital stub file). Most browsers allow visitors to control whether they accept a digest, reject a digest, or notify visitors each time a digest is sent. You can choose to reject digit stubs by adjusting your browser settings, but for BUPT Smart Home sites and other large sites that use digit stubs, doing so may limit visitors' access to site features. For more information on digital stubs, please visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</br>
                    <br><h4>(ii) Web Beacons</h4></br>
                           <br>When a user opens a web page that contains a web beacon, the web beacon, along with the digital stub, records a simple action taken by the user. When a user's browser requests information from a web site in this way, it can also collect simple information such as the IP address of your computer, the time and content of the web page viewed by the user, the type of browser used by the user, and the digital stubs previously set up by that server. This information is available to any web server you visit. Web beacons do not reveal any "extra" information. They are simply the easiest way to collect the simplest statistics and manage your cookies. Web beacons can be disabled (in the same way you can disable digital stubs).</br>
                           <br>How we share, transfer, and publicly disclose your personal information</br>
                    <br><h4>(i) Sharing</h4></br>
                            <br>We will not share your personal information with any company, organization or individual outside of BUPT Smart Home, except as follows.</br>
                            <br>1. Sharing with explicit consent: We will share your personal information with other parties after obtaining your explicit consent. If required by law, we will inform and obtain your explicit consent before sharing sensitive information.</br>
                            <br>2. Sharing under legal circumstances: We may share your personal information with external parties in accordance with laws and regulations, the need for litigation dispute resolution, or as required by law by administrative or judicial authorities.</br>
                            <br>3. Sharing with authorized partners: In order to achieve the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy, some of our services will be jointly provided by us and our authorized partners. We may share some of your personal information with our partners in order to provide better customer service and user experience. For example, when you redeem miles for a product, we must share your personal information with a logistics service provider to arrange delivery or to arrange for a partner to provide the service. We will only share your personal information for lawful, legitimate, necessary, specific, and explicit purposes, and only as much personal information as is necessary to provide the service. Our partners are not authorized to use the personal information shared for any other purpose unrelated to the product or service.</br>
                            <br>Currently, our authorized partners include the following types.</br>
                            <br>(1) Authorized partners in the category of advertising and analytical services. Unless we have your permission, we do not share your personally identifiable information (meaning information that identifies you, such as name or email address, by which you can be contacted or identified) with partners who provide advertising and analytics services. We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing personally identifiable information about you, or we may aggregate this information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell advertisers how effective their ads are, or how many people have seen their ads or installed the app after seeing them, or provide these partners with non-personally identifiable statistical information (e.g., "Male, 25-29 years old, located in Beijing ") to help them understand their audience or customers.</br>
                            <br>(2) Vendors, Service Providers and Other Partners. We send information to IT vendors, partners, and other companies involved in providing customer service or fulfilling customer requests that support our business, including providing technical infrastructure services, providing customer service, and sending mailings and postings.</br>
                            <br>5. For the purposes of data analysis, WeChat sharing and payment, location navigation, and accurate push services, our mobile may integrate third-party SDKs or other similar applications.</br>
                            <br>For companies, organizations and individuals with whom we share personal information, we will sign strict confidentiality agreements with them, requiring them to handle personal information including personal sensitive information in accordance with our instructions, this Privacy Policy and any other relevant confidentiality and security measures.</br>
                    <br><h4>(ii) Transfer</h4></br>
                           <br>We will not transfer your personal information to any company, organization or individual, except for the following.</br>
                           <br>(1) Transfer with express consent: After obtaining your express consent, we will transfer your personal information to other parties. If there is a legal requirement, we will inform and obtain your explicit consent before transferring sensitive information.</br>
                           <br>2. In the event of a merger, acquisition or bankruptcy liquidation situation of a service provider, or other situations involving mergers, acquisitions or bankruptcy liquidation involving the transfer of personal information, we will require the new company or organization holding your personal information to continue to be bound by this policy, or we will require the company, organization and individual to seek your authorized consent again.</br>
                    <br><h4>(iii) Public Disclosure</h4></br>
                           <br>We will only disclose your personal information publicly if we</br>
                           <br>1. with your express consent or based on your active choice, we may disclose your personal information publicly.</br>
                           <br>2、In the event that we are required to provide your personal information by law, regulation, mandatory administrative enforcement or judicial requirements, we may publicly disclose your personal information based on the type of personal information requested and the manner of disclosure. Subject to laws and regulations, when we receive a request for such disclosure, we will require that a legal document, such as a subpoena or letter of inquiry, must be produced in response. We strongly believe in being as transparent as possible about the information we are asked to provide, to the extent permitted by law. We carefully review all requests to ensure that they have a legal basis and are limited to data that law enforcement has a legal right to obtain for specific investigative purposes.
                    <br><h4>(iv) Exceptions to prior authorized consent for sharing, transfer, or public disclosure of personal information</h4></br>
                           <br>Prior authorized consent is not required for sharing, transferring, or publicly disclosing your personal information in the following cases.</br>
                           <br>1、Related to national security or national defense security.</br>
                           <br>2、Related to public safety, public health, and significant public interest</br>
                           <br>3, related to crime investigation, prosecution, trial and execution of judgments, etc.</br>
                           <br>4、For the purpose of safeguarding your or other individuals' life, property and other significant legitimate rights and interests but it is difficult to obtain your consent
                           <br>5、Personal information that you disclose to the public on your own.</br>
                           <br>6、Personal information collected from lawful public disclosures, such as lawful news reports, government information disclosure and other channels.</br>
                           <br>According to the law, sharing or transferring personal information that has been de-identified and ensuring that the recipient of the data cannot recover and re-identify the subject of the personal information is not an act of sharing, transferring and publicly disclosing personal information to the public, and the sharing and transfer of such data will not require separate notification to you and your consent.</br>
                    <br><h4>(v). How we protect and preserve your personal information</h4></br>
                            <br>(i) Our technology and measures to protect your personal information</br>
                            <br>We attach great importance to the security of personal information, and we will take all reasonable and feasible security control measures to protect your personal information:</br>
                            <br>1. We have used security measures that meet industry standards to protect the personal information you provide and prevent unauthorized access, public disclosure, use, modification, damage or loss of data. We will take all reasonably practicable steps to protect your personal information. For example, we use transport layer security protocol encryption technology and a combination of strong cryptographic algorithms (such as ECDSA key negotiation, AES256 channel encryption, and other technologies) to ensure the security of transactions during transmission; for stored personal information data, we adopt industry-standard strong encryption technology to encrypt and store users' personal information; and isolate it through segregation technology. Our access to the stored data is recorded and saved in the relevant logs, and the log files are not tampered with through centralized log collection and integrity monitoring; we also periodically perform internal and external security scans and penetration tests to ensure the security of the production system.</br>
                            <br>2. We have obtained the following certifications: our core business systems have been certified by the People's Republic of China for Information System Protection Level 3, and we have also obtained ISO27001 and PCI DSS certifications.</br>
                            <br>3. We have appointed a Data Protection Compliance Officer (DPO), who is fully responsible for the data protection and compliance operation of the enterprise. A Data Security Working Group has been established to promote and secure personal information. We regulate the collection, transmission, use and storage of personal information through our established information security management system. We sign Confidentiality Agreements with all employees and require all personnel who may have access to personal information to fulfill the corresponding confidentiality obligations. We provide regular training to our employees on information security and privacy protection to enhance their awareness of the importance of protecting personal information.</br>
                            <br>4、The Internet is not an absolutely secure environment, and communication methods such as e-mail are not encrypted, so we strongly recommend that you do not send personal information through such methods. Please use complex passwords to help us ensure the security of your account.</br>
                            <br>5. The Internet environment is not 100% secure, and we will do our best to ensure or warrant the security of any information you send us. If our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards are compromised, resulting in unauthorized access, public disclosure, tampering, or destruction of information, resulting in damage to your legal rights and interests, we will assume appropriate legal liability.</br>
                            <br>6、In order to cope with the possible risks of personal information leakage, destruction and loss, we have established emergency response measures for personal information leakage, classification and grading standards for leakage events, and established the process for reporting and corresponding disposal of events. We have established a special emergency response team. After the unfortunate occurrence of a personal information security incident, we will, in accordance with the requirements of laws and regulations, promptly inform you of: the basic situation and possible impact of the security incident, the disposal measures we have taken or will take, the suggestions you can independently prevent and reduce the risk, the remedial measures for you, etc. We will promptly inform you of the situation related to the incident by email, letter, telephone, push notification, etc. When it is difficult to inform the subject of personal information one by one, we will take a reasonable and effective way to issue an announcement. If you find that your personal information is leaked, please contact our customer service immediately so that we can take appropriate measures.</br>
